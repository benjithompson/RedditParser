 'leader. The *only* way to say otherwise is to buy into this proxy-war '
 'bullshit that the media has been propagating. Tom Perez is one of the most '
 'staunchly progressive members of the Democratic Party, and the *only* knock '
 "against him is that he was part of Obama's White House and didn't endorse "
 'Bernie, and therefore too "establishment" for folks like you whose official '
 'line is "check every single one of my ideological boxes or you\'re an enemy '
 'of the people."r/the_douchenozzle is literally posting telling people to '
 'spread the wikileaks emails from tom to hillary to divide us. Be careful '
 'when you see those links pop up in DNC threads The dems have decided they '
 'want to play the shit game with the progressives again. You know and that '
 'after they shot the first hostage the dems should know they mean it.You guys '
 'said the same thing about Hillary! Look how progressive she is.Perez '
 'supports the TPP. He can go rigg the GOP primary.A stunch progressive '
 'shilling for the TPP. Tom Perez is the new Tim Kaine the evidence that the '
 'Dems dont give a fuck.The dems knew what they would get if they dont appease '
 'the sanders wing and that is the price they have to pay.If dems run a '
 'sufficiently progressive candidate to appease you in 2020 and they crash and '
 "burn because they can't get enough moderate independents in the fold to beat "
 'Trump will you guys come to the table and work with the party then?Have you '
 'not seen what Senate seats (with Cook PVIs) they are tasked with defending '
 'in 2018?\n'

 '* West Virginia (R +13)\n'
 '* North Dakota (R+10)\n'
 '* Montana (R +7)\n'
 '* Indiana (R +5)\n'
 '* Missouri (R +5)\n'
 '* Florida (R +2)\n'
 '* Ohio (R +1)\n'
 '* Pennsylvania (D +1)\n'

 "ALL states that Trump won. I don't blame Dem leadership for being cautious. "
 'Republicans could have 60 votes easily.Perez is definitely further left than '
 'Hillary. Check his policies, he was a civil rights lawyer well before he was '
 "in politics. So did Obama. Are you gonna tell me that Obama wasn't a "
 "progressive? You know, there's more to politics and politics than the TPP. "
 "There're social issues like abortion and LGBT+ rights, economic issues like "
 'the budget and taxation, foreign policy like sanctions and treaties, and so '
 "much more. TPP is a small, small issue in today's politics. A person's "
 'support, or nonsupport, for it is not the end all and be all of their '
 "political stances. >check every single one of my ideological boxes or you're "
 'an enemy of the people \n'
 '\n'
 'Thank you for proving my point. "Tom Perez supported one thing I don\'t '
 'agree with when it was the official policy of the White House he worked for, '
 'therefore he\'s literally an anti-progressive DINO Republican-lite!"\n'

 'Frequent poster the r/the_dickbag. Please disregard and continue with your '
 "nights (if you're going to try and troll at least do it from a clean account "
 "and not one where you make your choices abundantly clear)If you're actually "
 "interested in progressive policies, please check Perez's. He was described "
 "as the most progressive guy in Obama's cabinet, and Bernie himself "
 'congratulated him. He immediately picked Ellison to be his deputy chair to '
 'unite the party, so if you actually give a shit about policy and not '
 'starting a little proxy war, please read up on him before commenting '
 'again.They wont they put their soldier in place to prevent the progressive '
 'from winning the primary.The difference between Perez and Ellison for the '
 'GOP is negliable.\n'
 '\n'
 'Most likely they didnt want Ellison to not scare jewish donors its all about '
 'money or\n'
 '\n'
 'they wanted just somebody they can control.Obama is a neo liberal.The dems '
 'want to rigg the next primary that is the default assumption now and they '
 'brought it upon themselves.He had to make the next primary unquestionable '
 'fair. Perez cant so it was the wrong choice.Perez is pro TPP he is out.Check '
 "his submission history. It's probably an alt he uses now to pretend to be a "
 'Bernie style progressive. He has lots of submissions to the donald then '
 'suddenly he spends all his time in politics trashing the dems.It was a '
 'hypothetical. If you got your candidate and they lost, would you come to the '
 "table and work with the party?All I'm saying is that a fractured left only "
 "helps the Republicans in 2018. I'm planning on volunteering for the best "
 'progressive that decides to run for President in 2020 but keeping the Senate '
 'from being blown wide open should be the short term goal for all on the '
 'left.Who do you consider a progressive, besides Ellison and Sanders?Perez '
 '"can\'t" because people like you call him a traitor and a shill for no other '
 "reason than that he didn't endorse Bernie and worked in the Obama White "
 'House. \n'
 '\n'
 'Ellison himself is totally on board with him and will serve as his Vice '
 'Chair. Bernie congratulated him after the vote. Get off your fucking high '
 "horse. Thanks. It's terribly ironic that Donald and his cronies complain "
 'endlessly about fake news and shills while simultaneously pretending to be '
 'democrats in order to try and sow division in the party. No integrity for '
 'some of these people.His mom probablyMany people it had to be Ellison after '
 'Schumer and Sanders endorsed him. If the dems fail it is on Obama now.Like '
 "blueshirtfanatic above pointed out above, you'd think he'd be clever enough "
 'to use an unsullied account.')
